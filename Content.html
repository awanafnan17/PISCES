            <h2 class="title">Fish</span></h2>
            <p>The term fish is applied to a variety of vertebrates of several evolutionary lines. It describes a life-form rather than a taxonomic group. As members of the phylum Chordata, fish share certain features with other vertebrates.</p>

    <h2>Bearded Seal</h2>
    <p>The bearded seal is the largest of all Arctic seals, growing to lengths of up to eight feet and weighing 575-800 pounds. These seals tend to weigh the most during winter and early spring when they have an extra layer of blubber under the skin. Sea ice is an important part of the bearded seal’s daily life. Ice floes are used for resting on between foraging for food and during pupping season. Individuals know to rest on single ice floes facing the water so they can escape quickly from predators. Bearded seals are benthic feeders, meaning they forage near the sea floor for a variety of bottom-dwelling invertebrates, including crab, shrimp, clams, Arctic cod and octopus. Bearded seals typically dive to depths of less than 100 meters (328 feet) for food.
    </p>
    <h2>Beluga Whale</h2>
    <p>  Belugas, however, are typically more solidly white than their grayish cousins. Adult belugas are also slightly larger than narwhals, reaching lengths of around 18 feet (5.5 m). Interestingly, the beluga whale is the only species of cetacean (whales and dolphins) that has a movable neck. Belugas can move their heads up and down and from side to side.
    </p>
    <h2>California Sea Lion</h2>
    <p>California sea lions are very communicative creatures. They can often be heard barking like dogs in their large social groups made up of hundreds of sea lions. When they’re not lounging on beaches and rocky shores, California sea lions are hunting at sea for several days at a time. They are fast swimmers, reaching top speeds of 25 miles per hour (40 kmph) and can stay underwater for up to 10 minutes in pursuit of prey.
    </p>
    <h2>Common Bottlenose Dolphin</h2>
    <p>Common bottlenose dolphins can be quite large, reaching weights of up to 1400 pounds (~640 kg) and lengths of 12.5 feet (~4 m). They are relatively long-lived (40-50 years) and reach sexual maturity at ages between 5 and 14 years old. Some individuals are known to be reproductively active for their entire lives, a rare characteristic among mammals. Like all mammals, common bottlenose dolphins reproduce through internal fertilization, and females give birth to live young. Juveniles are able to swim from the moment they are born, but they are totally dependent on nursing their mothers’ milk for nearly two years.</p>

    <h2>Dugong</h2>
    <p>The dugong, like all sea cows, is herbivorous. It primarily grazes on sea grasses and therefore spends most of its time in sea grass beds. Unlike the closely related manatees, the dugong never enters freshwater and is therefore the only exclusively marine mammal that is herbivorous. As in most herbivores, the dugong’s brain is very small compared to its body size, likely because it does not have to develop complex hunting strategies to capture prey. 

    </p>
    <h2>Hourglass Dolphin</h2>
    <p>The hourglass dolphin’s body is short and stocky, while the dorsal fin is tall and curved, sometimes even appearing bent towards the body in adult males. Their body narrows near the mouth where one of the dolphin’s white patches begins, extending over the eye and tapering off at the dorsal fin. The dolphin’s second white patch begins where the other ends and narrows at the tail, creating the iconic hourglass illusion. The hourglass dolphin is the only small dolphin that swims south of the Antarctic convergence where cold Antarctic waters meet the slightly warmer waters of the sub-antarctic. The largest concentrations of hourglass dolphins have been sighted in Drake Passage, which lies between the tip of South America and Antarctica.
    </p>
    <h2>Marine Otter</h2>
    <p>Marine otters are foraging predators that eat a wide variety of prey. While they prefer invertebrates, including crabs, clams, and other hard-shelled groups, they are also known to eat some fishes, juvenile birds, and even other mammals. They also scavenge for garbage, bringing them into close contact with people. Unlike many species of weasels, scientists believe the marine otter to be monogamous. Mating, birth, and nursing take place onshore, in protected dens. Adult marine otters are quite small. They only reach about 13 pounds (6 kg) vs. 100 pounds (45 kg) in sea otters.
    </p>
    <h2>Orca</h2>
    <p>Orcas get their nickname “killer whales” from their reputation of being ferocious predators, exhibiting almost hateful behaviors when toying with their prey. Interestingly, however, killer whales are actually very large dolphins, reaching lengths of 33 feet (10 m) and weights of at least 10 metric tones (22,000 pounds). Orcas and other dolphins are thought to be some of the smartest animals on the planet, challenging the great apes (chimps and gorillas) for the top spot. They are also extremely curious and often approach people to investigate. Their intelligence is likely both a result of and a driver of their complex social structures. They generally live in small groups and organize complex, group behaviors when mating and hunting. They are intelligent, playful, powerful animals – a worrisome combination if you happen to be their preferred prey. Different orca populations specialize on different prey types, including large bony fishes; seals, sea lions, and other large marine mammals; and penguins; among other things. 
    </p>
    <h2>Steller Sea Lion</h2>
    <p>Steller sea lions are generalist predators that eat a variety of large, marine fishes (Pacific Cod, Pollack, salmons, flatfishes, etc.), along with squids and octopuses. They are known to pester fishers by eating fishes out of their nets, bringing them into dangerous contact with humans. As they are some of the largest animals throughout their range, steller sea lions have few natural predators. However, both killer whales and great white sharks are known to occasionally eat them.
    </p>
    <h2>Vaquita</h2>
    <p>Reproductive output, however, is quite low – with females giving birth to only one calf, every other year – and the gestation period is 11 months, longer than most land mammals, including humans. Lifespan is also low, with individuals likely living no longer than approximately 25 years. Vaquitas are predatory and eat a variety of Gulf of California fishes, squids, and crustaceans. They are extremely shy and are therefore very difficult for scientists to study in their natural habitat. Much of our knowledge of vaquitas is a result of their being captured as bycatch in local net fisheries.
